Medium problem with Husky->
Husky is a tool that helps manage Git hooks in JavaScript/TypeScript projects. Git hooks are scripts that run automatically at certain points in the Git workflow, such as before committing or pushing code. Husky simplifies setting up these hooks, allowing developers to automate tasks like running linters, tests, or enforcing commit message formats. By integrating with Git, Husky ensures code quality and consistency before changes are committed or pushed. Itâ€™s commonly used in teams to prevent errors and enforce coding standards across projects.
